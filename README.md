### About

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, specializing in Machine Learning. At UMass, I worked with [Prof. Hao Zhang](https://hcr.cs.umass.edu/people/hzhang) at the [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://hcr.cs.umass.edu), focusing on Vision-Language Integration to enable robots to reference arbitrary objects. Prior to this, I collaborated with [Shane Moon](https://shanemoon.com/), [Andrea Madotto](https://andreamad8.github.io/) of [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs), and [Jay-Yoon Lee](https://leejayyoon.github.io/) of [IESL](https://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/) in areas of multi-modal video understanding with special focus on egocentric videos.

Currently based in Santa Clara, CA, I serve as **Founding Machine Learning Engineer** at [Dylog](https://dylog.ai), where I architect state-of-the-art conversational AI and search platforms purpose-built for wholesale distribution. My work focuses on integrating vision and language capabilities to create AI-powered solutions that enable seamless B2B commerce conversations across multiple channels.

I'm an active thought leader in enterprise AI, regularly publishing insights on agentic AI, AI governance, and enterprise AI infrastructure on my [blog](https://subramanya.ai). Recent writings cover topics including Context Graphs, the evolution of agentic infrastructure, Agent Skills, MCP (Model Context Protocol) security, and AI identity management. I've contributed to the OpenID Foundation's whitepaper on "Identity Management for Agentic AI," addressing critical challenges in authentication and authorization for AI agents.

Previously, I served as Head of Product Development at [RenderPub](https://www.renderpub.com). During my undergraduate years at the National Institute of Engineering, Mysore, I co-founded Yourkraft, a platform to streamline musician bookings, and Vayam, a non-profit dedicated to empowering individuals through education and equality.
