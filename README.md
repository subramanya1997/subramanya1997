### About

I am a graduate student at UMass Amherst, majoring in Computer Science. Currently I am advised by <a href='https://hcr.cs.umass.edu/people/hzhang'>Prof. Hao Zhang</a> at <a href='https://hcr.cs.umass.edu'>Human Centered Robotics Lab</a>, where I work on intersection of computer vision and natural language for Robotics. Prior to this I was advised by advised by <a href=https://shanemoon.com/>Shane Moon</a>, <a href="https://andreamad8.github.io/">Andrea Madotto</a> of <a href="https://about.meta.com/realitylabs">Meta Reality labs</a> and <a href="https://leejayyoon.github.io/">Jay-Yoon Lee</a> of <a href="https://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/">IESL</a> in areas of multi-modal video understanding with special focus on ego centric videos.

My current interests lie at the intersection of vision and language, and my research focuses on using information from multiple sources such as text, images, and video to improve commonsense reasoning capabilities of machines.

In the past, I worked as Head of Product Development for <a href='https://www.renderpub.com'>RenderPub, India</a>, and I have interned at <a href='https://www.vertica.com'>Vertica</a>. During my undergrad at National Institute of Engineering, Mysore, I co-founded Yourkraft a platform to manage and book musicians and Vayam (Non-Profit) a student run trust that aims to empowering people, with equality as the cornerstone and education as the tool in achieving it.
