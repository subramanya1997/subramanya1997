### About

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, specializing in Machine Learning. At UMass, I worked with [Prof. Hao Zhang](https://hcr.cs.umass.edu/people/hzhang) at the [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://hcr.cs.umass.edu), focusing on Vision-Language Integration to enable robots to reference arbitrary objects. Prior to this, I collaborated with [Shane Moon](https://shanemoon.com/), [Andrea Madotto](https://andreamad8.github.io/) of [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs) and [Jay-Yoon Lee](https://leejayyoon.github.io/) of [IESL](https://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/) in areas of multi-modal video understanding with special focus on egocentric videos.

Currently, I lead cutting-edge initiatives at [Dylog](https://dylog.ai), where I architect state-of-the-art conversational AI and search platforms, leveraging my expertise in machine learning and multi-modal systems. My work focuses on integrating vision and language capabilities to create more intuitive and powerful AI solutions. Concurrently, as a Co-Founder of [NockOut](https://nockout.co), I am driving innovation in sports and fitness management through technology.

Previously, I served as Head of Product Development at [RenderPub](https://www.renderpub.com), and completed an internship at [Vertica](https://www.vertica.com). During my undergraduate years at the National Institute of Engineering, Mysore, I co-founded Yourkraft, a platform to streamline musician bookings, and Vayam, a non-profit dedicated to empowering individuals through education and equality. These experiences have shaped my approach to building technology solutions that create meaningful impact.
